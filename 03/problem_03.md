# Rearrange Array Elements
Using quicksort to sort the element in descending order. once sorted 2 numbers are segregated by accessing he even and odd elements of the array. This helps in achieving highest 2 numbers from the left most index.

Time complexity O(n) = nlogn +2n => nlogn
Space Complexity O(n) = nlogn + n => nlogn
